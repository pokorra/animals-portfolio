# animals-portfolio
Website of the nonexistent pro-animals organization made entirely in pure CSS and JS.

Layout of this page is based on CSS variables and CSS animations, also pseudo elements were significant to general appearance of the site. I was kind of proud of myself when it occured to me I could try adding the dark mode switch - so I did it.
To animate grid section I used the wrapGrid by Alex Holachek - a really useful tool that I found on the github.
